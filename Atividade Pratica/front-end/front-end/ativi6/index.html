    <h1>Formulas</h1>
    <p>Water is a compound made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, represented by the chemical formula
        H<sub>2</sub>O. This notation indicates that there are two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom bonded
        together to form a molecule of water. The subscript "2" in H<sub>2</sub> indicates that there are two hydrogen
        atoms, while the oxygen atom is represented without a subscript, implying a single oxygen atom in the molecule.
